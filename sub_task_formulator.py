        Guidelines:
        - Form your questions based on the table of contents and the schema of the HRMS database.
        - DO NOT explain anything.
        - DO NOT provide a paragraph or answer.
        - DO NOT say "It depends" or give advice.
        - DO NOT include bullet points or context.
        - JUST OUTPUT clear questions that can be answered by the modules.
        - output your answer in JSON format.

        Output format:
        {
            "sub-tasks" : [
            {"module" : "Policy RAG", "question": "[your question here]"},
            {"module" : "Database RAG", "question": "[your question here]"}

            {"module" : "Database RAG", "question": "[your question here]"}
            ]
        }
