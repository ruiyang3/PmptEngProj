The \nuniversity’s equal employment opportunity and affirmative action commitments are met through the \nbroad-based, decentralized efforts of the campus community.  Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 8  \nThe administration of Carnegie Mellon's equal employment and affirmative action policies is a shared \nresponsibility. The president of the university, as well as the provost, vice presidents, deans, department \nheads and hiring supervisors, support the importance of affirmative action as a critical component of \nuniversity operations.  \nThrough administration of these equal employment opportunity and affirmative action policies, the \nuniversity intends to ensure that all people are included in the diversity that strengthens Carnegie Mellon \nin its pursuit of excellence. \nFor more information on this subject matter, refer to the university’s Equal Employment \nOpportunity/Affirmative Action Policy. \nAdditionally, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or \nadministration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition, family status, marital status, parental \nstatus, religion, ancestry, veteran status, or genetic information.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES \n1. Our Expectations \nYou are expected to give your best efforts at all times toward your assigned job duties. While you are on \nthe job, you are expected to be working, and using your time and Carnegie Mellon resources for the \npurpose of doing your job. \nEvery employee, regardless of the position held, has general responsibilities to Carnegie Mellon and its \ncommunity. These responsibilities include: maintaining high standards of quality and productivity; \nproperly caring for Carnegie Mellon equipment and property; having regular attendance; complying with \nall rules, regulations, policies and procedures of the university; cooperating with and respecting other \nmembers of the Carnegie Mellon community (including supervisors, co-workers, faculty and students) \nand their property; and generally demonstrating integrity as a Carnegie Mellon employee. \n2. Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) \nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires employers to verify the identity and \nemployment authorization of new employees within three days of hire. The United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services requires employees to provide identification and proof of their authorization to \nwork in the United States via the Form I-9. Reverification is required any time an individual experiences a \nchange in immigration status that affects work authorization. \nTo ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification \n(I-9) Policy, which set forth the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements for individuals employed by the \nuniversity or receiving a stipend through Payroll Services. For more information, refer to the Employment \nEligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf]. \n3. Staff Background Checks \nIn order to protect the safety and well-being of its students, employees, and visitors and to avoid \nreputational or other harm to the university, Carnegie Mellon requires all individuals to satisfy \nbackground checks prior to beginning employment in a United States based staff position with the \nuniversity and post-hire when required by law or deemed necessary based on the duties of the position. \nFor more information, refer to the Staff Background Check Policy [pdf]. \n4. Drug and Alcohol Policy for Department of Transportation (DOT) Covered \nEmployees \nCarnegie Mellon University has established an alcohol and controlled substances testing program for its \nemployees who are drivers of Carnegie Mellon’s Commercial Motor Vehicles and who require \nCommercial Drivers Licenses, to meet requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nand the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). \nFor more information, refer to Carnegie Mellon’s Drug and Alcohol Policy for DOT-Covered Employees \n[pdf].  Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 11  \n5. Driver’s License and Driver Training Protocol \nThis protocol applies to employees whose job classification or position requires, as an essential job \nfunction, that they operate a vehicle on university business, and therefore possess and maintain a valid \ndriver’s license and/or any special driving certification. Hiring supervisors should include the requirement \nto operate a vehicle as an essential job function only after review with the Office of Human Resources in \nadvance of posting and recruiting for a position. \nDriver’s License Verification: The Office of Human Resources has the responsibility to verify the validity of \nan employee’s driver’s license and acceptability of their driver’s citation record on file with the state as a \ncondition of employment with signed authorization from the employee. Employees who refuse \nauthorization may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including involuntary separation of \nemployment. The university has sole discretion regarding the acceptability of the driver’s citation record. \nDefensive Driver/Driver Safety Training — University Vehicles: Those employees who are subject to this \nprotocol and who drive university vehicles are required to take Driver Safety Training every three years, \nat a minimum. This training is in addition to any driver training that is required by the department, which \nmay include training that is specific to a type of vehicle, or a particular situation, or as a result of an at-\nfault accident or at-work driver’s license violation. A university vehicle includes vehicles that are licensed \nfor road use and may be owned, leased, rented or otherwise under the legal custody and/or control of \nthe university. \nLoss or Suspension/Restriction of Driver’s License: In the event of loss or suspension/restriction of driver’s \nlicense and/or any required driving certification, the employee must notify their immediate supervisor \nbefore operating a vehicle on university business but no later than 48 hours after learning of the \nsuspension/restriction. An employee who has been charged with a violation of statutes that affects their \ndriver’s license or who has their driving privileges suspended, revoked or barred for violating such \nstatues, including but not limited to operating a vehicle while intoxicated, vehicular homicide or habitual \nviolation, shall not be permitted to operate a vehicle on behalf of the university for a period of three \nmonths or until the time when the Department of Transportation or the appropriate state licensing \nagency restores the employee’s ability to drive, whichever occurs last. The suspension of university \ndriving privileges shall take effect at the same time as the state imposed suspension/restriction of the \ndriver’s license. Where an employee has been charged with a violation of the above-referenced statutes, \nthe university reserves the right to suspend university driving privileges even if the state has not imposed",

Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) \nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires employers to verify the identity and \nemployment authorization of new employees within three days of hire. The United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services requires employees to provide identification and proof of their authorization to \nwork in the United States via the Form I-9. Reverification is required any time an individual experiences a \nchange in immigration status that affects work authorization. \nTo ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon maintains the Employment Eligibility Verification \n(I-9) Policy, which set forth the university’s I-9 and E-Verify requirements for individuals employed by the \nuniversity or receiving a stipend through Payroll Services. For more information, refer to the Employment \nEligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf]. \n3. Staff Background Checks \nIn order to protect the safety and well-being of its students, employees, and visitors and to avoid \nreputational or other harm to the university, Carnegie Mellon requires all individuals to satisfy \nbackground checks prior to beginning employment in a United States based staff position with the \nuniversity and post-hire when required by law or deemed necessary based on the duties of the position. \nFor more information, refer to the Staff Background Check Policy [pdf]. \n4. Drug and Alcohol Policy for Department of Transportation (DOT) Covered \nEmployees \nCarnegie Mellon University has established an alcohol and controlled substances testing program for its \nemployees who are drivers of Carnegie Mellon’s Commercial Motor Vehicles and who require \nCommercial Drivers Licenses, to meet requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nand the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). \nFor more information, refer to Carnegie Mellon’s Drug and Alcohol Policy for DOT-Covered Employees \n[pdf].  Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 11  \n5. Driver’s License and Driver Training Protocol \nThis protocol applies to employees whose job classification or position requires, as an essential job \nfunction, that they operate a vehicle on university business, and therefore possess and maintain a valid \ndriver’s license and/or any special driving certification. Hiring supervisors should include the requirement \nto operate a vehicle as an essential job function only after review with the Office of Human Resources in \nadvance of posting and recruiting for a position. \nDriver’s License Verification: The Office of Human Resources has the responsibility to verify the validity of \nan employee’s driver’s license and acceptability of their driver’s citation record on file with the state as a \ncondition of employment with signed authorization from the employee. Employees who refuse \nauthorization may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including involuntary separation of \nemployment. The university has sole discretion regarding the acceptability of the driver’s citation record. \nDefensive Driver/Driver Safety Training — University Vehicles: Those employees who are subject to this \nprotocol and who drive university vehicles are required to take Driver Safety Training every three years, \nat a minimum. This training is in addition to any driver training that is required by the department, which \nmay include training that is specific to a type of vehicle, or a particular situation, or as a result of an at-\nfault accident or at-work driver’s license violation. A university vehicle includes vehicles that are licensed \nfor road use and may be owned, leased, rented or otherwise under the legal custody and/or control of \nthe university. \nLoss or Suspension/Restriction of Driver’s License: In the event of loss or suspension/restriction of driver’s \nlicense and/or any required driving certification, the employee must notify their immediate supervisor \nbefore operating a vehicle on university business but no later than 48 hours after learning of the \nsuspension/restriction. An employee who has been charged with a violation of statutes that affects their \ndriver’s license or who has their driving privileges suspended, revoked or barred for violating such \nstatues, including but not limited to operating a vehicle while intoxicated, vehicular homicide or habitual \nviolation, shall not be permitted to operate a vehicle on behalf of the university for a period of three \nmonths or until the time when the Department of Transportation or the appropriate state licensing \nagency restores the employee’s ability to drive, whichever occurs last. The suspension of university \ndriving privileges shall take effect at the same time as the state imposed suspension/restriction of the \ndriver’s license. Where an employee has been charged with a violation of the above-referenced statutes, \nthe university reserves the right to suspend university driving privileges even if the state has not imposed \na suspension/restriction. Employees are required to immediately report any violation of the above-\nreferenced statutes to their supervisor. \nDisciplinary Action for Failure to Maintain a Driver’s License and/or Driving Privileges: An employee whose job \nclassification or position requires the possession and maintenance of a driver’s license and/or any \nrequired special driving certification in order to perform the essential functions of the job and who \nsubsequently has their license, special certification, and/or university driving privileges revoked, \nrescinded, suspended or the renewal denied, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 12  \ninvoluntary separation of employment for failure to maintain the necessary qualification required for that \nposition. \n6. Intellectual Property Policy \nUpon accepting employment, new staff members are required to review and sign an agreement that \naddresses the ownership of intellectual property. For more information, refer to the Intellectual Property \nPolicy. \n7. Provisional Period \nNew staff members are hired under a six-month provisional period. During this time, the staff member \ndetermines whether or not the position meets their expectations, and the supervisor determines \nwhether or not the staff member has the knowledge and skills to perform the job satisfactorily. The \nprovisional period is a time for open communication by both parties about what is going well and what \nneeds improvement. \nYour supervisor may offer feedback on your work performance during the provisional period. In some \ndepartments, this feedback includes a formal performance review during the provisional period and \nanother at its conclusion. \nIf you and your supervisor cannot resolve some area of dissatisfaction during your initial provisional \nperiod, either party may terminate the employment relationship without prior notice. A new staff \nmember is not eligible to use the staff grievance procedure (described in the Staff Relations section) \nduring the initial provisional period unless the issue involves alleged discrimination. \nA provisional period also applies to current staff members who transfer into new positions within the \nsame department or to a different department at the university. Since these staff members have already \nserved an initial provisional period of employment, these staff members are eligible to use the staff \ngrievance procedure. \nCompletion of the provisional period does not entitle an employee to remain employed by Carnegie \nMellon for any definite period of time. Both the employee and Carnegie Mellon are free, at any time, with \nor without notice and with or without cause, to end the employment relationship. \n8. Hours of Work \nThe standard workweek for full-time staff members at Carnegie Mellon is 37.5 hours. \n8A. Work Schedules/Attendance \nThe Carnegie Mellon workweek begins at 12:01 a.m. on Monday. Though most staff work from 8:30 a.m. \nto 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, you may be assigned a different schedule based on your position and \nyour department's needs. \nFull-time staff members normally work 7.5 hours a day with an unpaid meal period. Part-time staff may \nhave an unpaid meal period depending on the length of their workday. Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 13  \nYou are expected to be at work on time and to work a full schedule each day. If illness or other problems \nwill cause you to miss work, you are asked to notify your supervisor within the first hour of your \nscheduled workday. \n8B. Meal Periods and Breaks \nMeal periods and breaks should be coordinated with your supervisor. Meal periods are unpaid and last \nat least one half-hour, but not more than one hour. \nScheduled breaks are optional at Carnegie Mellon and are determined by each department. Your \nsupervisor will know if breaks are scheduled in your area. If scheduled, breaks are limited to 15 minutes \nper day and are paid.  \n9. Flexible Work Arrangements \nIn recognition of the diversity of organizational needs, Carnegie Mellon offers flexible work arrangements \nfor eligible staff members in situations where the business needs of the college/division can be equally or \nbetter met while allowing the staff member to balance professional and personal responsibilities. Flexible \nwork arrangements, which are intended to support productivity and increase engagement, are available \nat the discretion of the staff member’s supervisor and can be modified or discontinued by the university \nat any time. \nAt Carnegie Mellon, a flexible work arrangement (FWA) is the organizing of work such that the work \nlocation or work schedule meets the university’s needs while balancing the staff member’s work and \npersonal needs. FWAs can address the scheduling of work hours and/or the place where the work is \ndone. Carnegie Mellon offers four types of flexible work arrangements; however, not all types of flexible \nwork are suitable for all positions: \n1. Flexible Schedule: A schedule that allows the staff member to adjust their start and end times, \nwithin certain limits, but does not alter the total number of hours worked in a workweek.  \n2.

Compressed Schedule: A schedule in which the number of hours expected to be worked each \nweek are accomplished in less than the standard number of workdays. The most common form of \ncompressed schedule accommodates the standard number of hours in a four-day workweek.  \n3. Remote Work: An arrangement in which the staff member works away from an assigned \nCarnegie Mellon office or workspace (i.e., CMU campus, satellite office, etc.). Generally, the \nlocation of a remote worker is outside the geographical vicinity of the Carnegie Mellon worksite, \nand the staff member is not expected to travel regularly to the Carnegie Mellon office or \nworkspace. Approval for remote work is location-specific (based on city and state). Separate \napproval is required for staff members who wish to work from multiple cities/states or for staff \nmembers who wish to change the city/state from which remote work is performed.  \n4. Telecommuting: An arrangement that allows the staff member to have an alternative work \nlocation (usually their home) and not commute to a Carnegie Mellon office or workspace for part \nor all of the workweek. A telecommuting staff member is generally within geographic proximity to \na Carnegie Mellon worksite and can be expected to engage in meetings and activities on site.

Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct \nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon to maintain an academic and work environment that promotes the \nconfidence to work, study, innovate and perform without fear of discrimination, harassment, or sexual \nmisconduct. Such misconduct diminishes individual dignity, is contrary to the values of the university and \nis a barrier to fulfilling the university’s mission. It will not be tolerated at Carnegie Mellon.  \nIt is the responsibility of every member of the university community to foster an environment free of \ndiscrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. All members of the university community are \nencouraged to take reasonable and prudent actions to prevent or stop such behavior.  \nThe university’s Statement of Assurance prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination or harassment. \nSpecifically, Carnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or \nadministration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, age, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition, family status, parental status, marital \nstatus, religion, ancestry, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University \ndoes not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws or \nexecutive orders. The university’s Interim Discriminatory and Sexual Misconduct Policy contains grievance \nprocedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of Complaints alleging any action which \nis prohibited by the Statement of Assurance. \nThe university’s Interim Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits all forms of discrimination \non the basis of any Protected Class, including disparate treatment discrimination, discriminatory \nharassment, sex-based harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, stalking, \ndating violence, domestic violence, retaliation, and violation of protective measures (collectively referred \nto as “Prohibited Conduct”). Detailed definitions of the categories of Prohibited Conduct are set forth in \nthe Policy.  \nAll staff members are expected to be familiar with and must abide by these Policies.

Layoff \nOn occasion, budget cutbacks, reorganizations, changes in leadership, or decreased funding lead to a \nreduction in the university's workforce. When this occurs, factors such as (but not necessarily limited to) Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 23  \nskills, experience, job performance, employment history and length of service may influence decisions on \neliminating jobs and separating employment. Regular, full-time staff members who are laid off due to \nbudget cutbacks, reorganizations, changes in leadership, or decreased funding will receive at least one \nmonth's notice in writing, or pay for one month in lieu of prior written notice or a combination of written \nnotice and pay totaling one month. \nYour HR business partner is available to provide you with information about employment practices and \nprocedures. You are encouraged to review the CMU careers site and apply to any opportunity that seems \nto be a good match with your career goals and experience. The university cannot guarantee that a new \nposition will be found. \nA staff member who has been laid off may continue in a university health insurance program under the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) for up to 18 months by paying the full cost of \nthe insurance. Staff members re-employed within 12 months of layoff will retain their original \nemployment date for purposes of calculating PTO entitlement, but no PTO is accrued during the layoff \nitself. Reinstatement in the retirement plan is governed by the terms of the plan. Staff separated as a \nresult of a layoff will be paid for accrued, unused PTO per the PTO policy guidelines and may be eligible \nfor unemployment compensation.  Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 24  \nIII. COMPENSATION  AND BENEFITS  \n1. Compensation \nCarnegie Mellon’s compensation philosophy is that, through a market-competitive, performance-based \ncompensation program, the university can attract, develop and retain the talent necessary to realize its \nvision of transforming society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity and \nentrepreneurship.  \nThrough its compensation philosophy and strategy, the university provides equitable and competitive \npay practices designed to fulfill Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to nondiscrimination with regard to age, \nancestry, belief, color, creed, gender identity, genetic information, handicap or disability, national origin, \nrace, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other category or characteristic protected by \napplicable law.   \nAs a part of the associated processes and administration of compensation across the university, each \nposition is required to have an up-to-date job description (JD) on file. The JD is a key tool in keeping \nCarnegie Mellon’s compensation structure aligned with its philosophy, strategic principles and the job \nclassification model.

Layoff \nOn occasion, budget cutbacks, reorganizations, changes in leadership, or decreased funding lead to a \nreduction in the university's workforce. When this occurs, factors such as (but not necessarily limited to) Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 23  \nskills, experience, job performance, employment history and length of service may influence decisions on \neliminating jobs and separating employment. Regular, full-time staff members who are laid off due to \nbudget cutbacks, reorganizations, changes in leadership, or decreased funding will receive at least one \nmonth's notice in writing, or pay for one month in lieu of prior written notice or a combination of written \nnotice and pay totaling one month. \nYour HR business partner is available to provide you with information about employment practices and \nprocedures.

Compensation \nCarnegie Mellon’s compensation philosophy is that, through a market-competitive, performance-based \ncompensation program, the university can attract, develop and retain the talent necessary to realize its \nvision of transforming society through continual innovation in education, research, creativity and \nentrepreneurship.  \nThrough its compensation philosophy and strategy, the university provides equitable and competitive \npay practices designed to fulfill Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to nondiscrimination with regard to age, \nancestry, belief, color, creed, gender identity, genetic information, handicap or disability, national origin, \nrace, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other category or characteristic protected by \napplicable law.   \nAs a part of the associated processes and administration of compensation across the university, each \nposition is required to have an up-to-date job description (JD) on file. The JD is a key tool in keeping \nCarnegie Mellon’s compensation structure aligned with its philosophy, strategic principles and the job \nclassification model. This multi-purpose document, which outlines the duties, requirements and \nresponsibilities of the job, is used in the following ways:  \n• To define the position  \n• To establish the market value of the position, compare the position to others on campus and \ndetermine Fair Labor Standards Act status (job evaluation) \n• To recruit candidates to fill a position  \n• To establish a hiring salary  \n• As the standard by which an incumbent’s performance is evaluated and rewarded  \nAs such, it is critical that each new position has an accurate JD and that the JD remains up to date.  \nThe Office of Human Resources (OHR) staff are available to assist with all compensation related matters. \nAs OHR is tasked with executing Carnegie Mellon’s compensation program in collaboration with colleges \nand divisions, the university encourages hiring managers and supervisors to work in close association \nwith their HR business partners from the onset of any new hire or subsequent compensation adjustment. \nThe goal of early collaboration is to facilitate and streamline the compensation process and to ensure \nthat compensation practices remain in line with the university’s compensation philosophy. Hiring \nmanagers and supervisors are encouraged to contact their HR business partner for guidance, compliance \nassistance, and support regarding all compensation-related needs.  \nFor more information, refer to the following compensation resources: \n• Compensation Guidelines – Staff [pdf] \n• Compensation Guidelines – Activity Pay and One-Time Payments [pdf] \n• Guidelines for the Use of Compensation Data (External and Internal) at CMU [pdf] Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 25  \n• The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): Guidance on FLSA Status, Overtime and Nonexempt Employee \nTimekeeping [pdf] \n1A. Safe Harbor Policy \nIt is Carnegie Mellon’s intent 1) to pay all employees qualifying as exempt under the current provisions of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) on a salary basis, 2) to prohibit improper deductions from the salary \nof FLSA exempt employees, and 3) to correct any improper deductions. \nRefer to Carnegie Mellon’s Safe Harbor Policy [pdf] for more information.  \n2. Employment Date \nThe day you begin working at Carnegie Mellon as a paid, non-student staff member is your employment \ndate. Your eligibility to participate in benefit plans, accumulation of PTO days and other criteria related to \nlength of service at the university are based on your employment date. \nEmployees who end employment at Carnegie Mellon after September 1, 1989 for reasons other than \nthose listed under Unsatisfactory Work Performance and Other Involuntary Separations and return to \npaid, non-student employment within one year will not have a break in employment. You will continue to \nuse your original employment date for determining your annual accrual of PTO days and for other \ncriteria related to length of service at the university. However, if your time away from Carnegie Mellon \nemployment lasts for more than one year from your date of separation, your employment date will be \nthe date you resume employment with Carnegie Mellon. \n3.

For full-time, benefits-\neligible employees, the basic life insurance includes an AD&D component. If your death is the result of an \naccident, your beneficiary will receive double your insurance amount. AD&D coverage also pays a certain \namount if you lose a limb or certain vital functions as a result of an accident. \nMonth After Death Benefit: In the event an eligible full-time faculty or staff member dies while actively \nemployed by the university (employees on disability leave are not eligible), their life insurance \nbeneficiaries will receive a cash payment equal to one month's pay: one-ninth of an academic year salary \nor one-twelfth of a twelve-month employee's salary. For eligible Campus Police Association members, \nthis equals 168 hours of straight-time pay. To be eligible for this feature, you must have one year of \ncontinuous service at Carnegie Mellon.

Eligibility and PTO Calculation \nBeginning with the first day of the month coinciding with or following their date of employment, and on \nthe first day of each month thereafter, regular, full-time staff members earn Paid Time Off (PTO). Staff \nmembers whose employment terms are four months or less are not regular, full-time staff members. An \nemployee must be actively at work (not on leave of absence) to earn PTO. The amount of PTO earned is \nbased on years of service at Carnegie Mellon according to the PTO accrual schedule below. Whenever \npossible, PTO should be scheduled in full-day or half-day increments. However, in non-medical and non-\nemergency cases in which the supervisor has granted prior approval, or in cases of medical necessity or \nemergency where obtaining prior approval is not possible, employees may schedule time in one-hour \nincrements. \nExcept in the case of illness or emergency, PTO days must be scheduled in advance and are subject to \nsupervisor approval. If a staff member takes PTO without prior approval for medical or emergency \nreasons, the university reserves the right to require medical or other documentation of the reasons given \nfor the unapproved PTO. PTO may not be used to receive pay in excess of wages earned for a normal Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 29  \nwork day and PTO is not counted for purposes of calculating overtime pay. The total amount of hours \nworked plus hours taken as PTO in a single day may not exceed the number of hours in an employee’s \nnormal daily work schedule. PTO days may be taken for vacation, personal time, illness or time off to care \nfor dependents. Holidays, jury duty and bereavement days are provided under separate policies and do \nnot count as PTO days. \nCarnegie Mellon University reserves the right to make exceptions or alterations to this policy where \nrequired by applicable local law. \nFor employees working in California or Rwanda, refer to the specific location’s Handbook for more \ninformation or other applicable addendum. \nPTO is earned as follows: \nYears of Service PTO Days Earned  \nPer Month \nMaximum PTO Days Earned  \nPer Year \nUp to & including year 3 1.42 days \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 days \nBeginning year 4 1.67 days 20 days \nBeginning year 8 2.08 days 25 days \nBeginning year 16 2.50 days 30 days \n \nFor example, a staff member who is in their fourth employment year (has completed three full years of \nservice) would earn 1.67 PTO days per month, or 20 days per employment year. \nPTO days are not earned during any leave of absence. (If an employee is on a leave of absence on the \nfirst day of a month, PTO will not accrue for that month.) Employees resume earning and accruing PTO \non the first day of the month following their return to work. (If they return to work on the first of the \nmonth, they will resume earning PTO on that day.) \nWhen a staff member’s status changes from full-time to part-time, the final monthly paycheck will include \npayment for any accrued, unused PTO days to which the employee is entitled. \nPTO days are not earned during part-time employment. However, part-time staff members who are \nsubsequently hired into a full-time, benefits-eligible position may count each year in which they have \nworked 1,000 hours or more while part-time as a year of service on the PTO schedule. For example, if a \npart-time staff member worked 1,000 hours during each of four employment years and then became a \nfull-time, benefits- eligible staff member, they would be eligible for 1.67 PTO days per month during the \nfirst year of full-time employment. \nAny questions regarding PTO earned and used should be directed to your supervisor. Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 30  \n7B. Unused PTO Carryover \nUp to one year's accrual of PTO that is earned but not taken may be carried over to the following \nemployment year. However, the number of days carried over cannot exceed the number of PTO days for \nwhich you are eligible in the following year. For example, if you are at the end of your fourth year of \nemployment and have accumulated 25 PTO days, you are permitted to carry over as many as 20 PTO \ndays into your fifth employment year. Questions about carryover may be referred to your supervisor. \n7C. Reserve Sick Days \nPTO days that cannot be carried over may",

Unused PTO Carryover \nUp to one year's accrual of PTO that is earned but not taken may be carried over to the following \nemployment year. However, the number of days carried over cannot exceed the number of PTO days for \nwhich you are eligible in the following year. For example, if you are at the end of your fourth year of \nemployment and have accumulated 25 PTO days, you are permitted to carry over as many as 20 PTO \ndays into your fifth employment year. Questions about carryover may be referred to your supervisor. \n7C. Reserve Sick Days \nPTO days that cannot be carried over may be added to your sick day bank as Reserve Sick Days (RSDs). A \nmaximum of 130 RSDs may be accumulated. If you become disabled, RSDs may be used in lieu of \nreceiving benefits under the Short-Term Disability Plan. To use RSDs, however, staff members must \napply for short-term disability benefits. By using RSDs rather than short-term disability benefits, you \nreceive 100 percent of your weekly salary instead of 60 percent as provided under the university's Short-\nTerm Disability Plan. (See description of the Short-Term Disability Plan.) Unused RSDs are not paid upon \nseparation and are forfeited. \n7D. Limitations \nWhen a staff member separates from full-time employment with Carnegie Mellon, in most cases they will \nbe paid for earned but unused PTO days, up to a maximum of the annual entitlement for that \nemployment year. If at separation the PTO days taken by the staff member exceed the number of PTO \ndays earned, including carryover PTO days, payment for the unearned days will be deducted from the \nstaff member's final paycheck. \nA staff member cannot use PTO on the last day of employment. Unless on an approved leave of absence, \na staff member must be actively working on the date employment ends.  \nNo payment for unused PTO days will be made to survivors of staff who die while employed at the \nuniversity. \nIf a work-related emergency or unexpected work requirement causes you to forego scheduled and \napproved PTO, you should discuss the situation with your supervisor. Your supervisor can help you to \nresolve this situation in consultation with the HR business partner as required. \nFor more information, refer to Carnegie Mellon University's Paid Time Off Policy. \n8. Paid Sick Days \nThe City of Pittsburgh Paid Sick Days Act went into effect on March 15, 2020.

Eligible employees may use paid sick days for their own illness or medical care, a family \nmember's illness or medical care, or in the event of a declared public health emergency. All eligible \nemployees may begin to use their accrued time beginning on the 90th day following the start of their \nemployment. Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 31  \nWhen the need to use paid sick days is foreseeable, the employee must submit a request in advance. \nWhen the need to use paid sick days is not foreseeable (e.g., due to sudden illness or emergency), the \nemployee should provide notice to the supervisor and submit a request at least one hour before the \nbeginning of the employee’s normal schedule or as soon as possible under the circumstances. \nPlease Note: Employees who are currently eligible for paid time off through the university (including \nPTO, Special Faculty Vacation and Local 95 Sick Time) are not eligible for Pittsburgh Paid Sick Leave. \nFind detailed information on Paid Sick Days. \n  Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 32  \n9.

Staff Grievance Procedure: A Formal Process for Resolving Work Related \nProblems \nWhere an employee believes they have wrongly been subjected to an “adverse action,” they can file a \nformal staff grievance through the process outlined in this section. For purposes of this formal grievance \nprocess, “adverse action” is defined to include suspension without pay, demotion (movement to a \nposition in another classification at a lesser level of responsibility and lower pay grade; a demotion is \nnormally accompanied by a reduction in compensation), and furlough. \n Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 39  \nThe grievance procedure is available to all staff members who have completed their provisional period, \nor for those staff members who did not have a provisional period, at least six months of employment \nwith Carnegie Mellon. Staff members who have not satisfied this length of service requirement may not \nfile a grievance. This process is not available to staff represented by a union or to faculty. \nStaff members can use the grievance procedure without fear of reprisal or retaliation. It is a clear \nviolation of university policy for a supervisor to retaliate against a staff member who uses the grievance \nprocedure. Refer to the Policy Against Retaliation.  \nIf there is more than one staff member involved in a particular matter as a grievant, each staff grievant is \nrequired to file a separate grievance. The university has discretion to determine whether related \ngrievances will be investigated and resolved individually or together.  \nA grievant may have another university staff member assist them in preparing a grievance statement or \naccompany them at any time during the grievance process. This individual can be from the staff \nmember's department, a member of Staff Council, or any other staff member of the university. The staff \nmember who is supporting the grievant is there to provide support and is not authorized to speak for or \notherwise represent the grievant. Since the grievance procedure is provided for the internal resolution of \nproblems and is not a legal forum, staff members may not be accompanied by legal counsel or anyone \nelse who is not employed by the university. \nNote: The staff grievance process is not intended to address issues of discrimination, harassment, any \nform of sexual misconduct, or research misconduct, nor is it intended as a forum to review employee \ndiscipline resulting from such issues. Staff members who wish to file a formal charge of discrimination or \nsexual misconduct should refer to the Interim Discriminatory and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the \nOffice for Institutional Equity and Title IX. Staff members who wish to file a formal allegation of research \nmisconduct should refer to the Research Misconduct Policy.

Filing a Grievance \nTo commence a grievance, the staff member (“grievant”) submits a written statement describing the \nwork-related problem and detailing the relevant facts and circumstances. The grievance statement \nshould be submitted to the employee labor and relations partner (“ELRP”). Because it is more difficult to \ninvestigate and resolve outdated issues, grievances must be submitted to the ELRP in writing within 30 \ncalendar days of the effective date of the adverse action or 30 days from the date the employee is \nnotified of or otherwise learns of the action, whichever is later. \nThe following information should be included: \n• Grievance Statement — A detailed description of the work-related issue.  \n• Background — A statement of the relevant facts supporting the grievant’s position, including \ninformation about the impact the issue has had or is having on the staff member. Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 40  \n• Requested Resolution — A statement of what the grievant is requesting as a satisfactory \nresolution to the grievance. \nDuring the process, a grievant may supplement their initial grievance statement with additional \ninformation or documents in order to clarify the issues further. However, they cannot expand the scope \nof a grievance once it has been submitted for consideration. If a grievant who has already filed a \ngrievance wishes to pursue a new and different issue, a new grievance must be filed. The grievant may \nstop the grievance process at any time by giving written notice to the ELRP. \n3B. Steps in the Grievance Procedure  \nThere are a number of steps in the grievance procedure which involve review of the matter by \nsuccessively higher levels of supervisors in the grievant’s reporting structure. The first review is by the \ndirect supervisor, the second is by the department/division/unit head, and the third and final level of \nreview is by the dean or vice president. If the grievant has already discussed the matter with the direct \nsupervisor without resolution, or the grievant would prefer not to address the matter with the direct \nsupervisor, the initial review may take place at the second step. The ELRP is available to explain this \nprocess to anyone considering filing a grievance, and will provide process advice during a grievance.  \nThe decision at each step is final unless the grievant submits a timely, written request for further review \nat the next step.  \nThe timelines below for response at each stage are intended to set general expectations; it is understood \nthat the responsible supervisor at each stage may take as much time as is necessary to render a decision \nor attempt to achieve resolution. \nReview by ELRP \nNormally, within 10 business days of receipt of the written grievance statement, the AVPHR determines if \nthe submitted matter is grievable, as described in Section 3, and takes one of the following actions: \na. If the ELRP determines the matter is not grievable, the ELRP sends a written response to the \ngrievant explaining the decision. Such determination shall be final and cannot be appealed. As \nappropriate, the ELRP may refer the grievance or portions of the grievance for review under other \napplicable policies. \nb. If the ELRP determines that the matter is grievable, the ELRP will do the following within 10 \nbusiness days after making that determination: (i) meet with the grievant to discuss the issues \nraised in the grievance and possible resolutions; and (ii) forward a copy of the grievance to the \ndirect supervisor, and notify the relevant department/division/unit head that a grievance has been \nfiled. \nStep 1: Review and Resolution by Direct Supervisor \nAt Step 1, the ELRP will take the following actions: Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 41  \na.

Disciplinary Guidelines \nIf a staff member's work performance is not satisfactory, or if the staff member has violated university \npolicy, it is the supervisor's responsibility to take corrective action. To determine an appropriate course of \naction, the supervisor considers the staff member's status (whether the staff member is serving a \nprovisional period), the nature and severity of the work performance issue, the frequency with which the \nproblem has occurred and any extenuating circumstances. \nSome situations, for example, may prompt a supervisor to take disciplinary action (including suspension \nor involuntary separation of employment, or both) without following all of the steps outlined below. The Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 42  \nsteps identified in items 4C, 4D, and 4E are generally undertaken only after the supervisor has discussed \nthe performance issue with their manager and the HR business partner. \nFor further information, please refer to Provisional Period, Employment Separation and Personnel \nRecords in the Employment Policies and Procedures section, and the Staff Grievance Procedure in this \nsection. \nNothing in this procedure is intended to, or in any way does, alter the at-will employment relationship \nbetween employees and Carnegie Mellon.  \nThe following disciplinary guidelines have been developed. \n4A. Performance Coaching \nPerformance coaching is often an effective means of resolving work-related problems while promoting \nmutual respect between staff members and supervisors. As part of this ongoing process, the supervisor \nidentifies areas that need to be improved and specifies a method of improvement. When discussing work \nperformance, the supervisor provides specific feedback to the staff member about how to improve \nperformance. If coaching does not result in improved performance, the supervisor has a number of \noptions, including those described below. \n4B. Verbal Warning \nA verbal warning directs a staff member's attention to a work performance issue or other work-related \nproblem by giving the staff member specific information about the nature of the problem, the \nimprovement needed, a timetable for future review, and the consequences of continued unsatisfactory \nperformance. At this time, the supervisor will also share additional resources and/or support available to \nthe staff member that may help them address the identified performance gap or help rectify the work-\nrelated problem. Once a verbal warning is communicated, there will be ongoing communication between \nthe supervisor and the staff member about the issue or problem. \n4C. Written Warning \nIf a staff member does not meet the performance standards or other work-related expectations \ncommunicated by the supervisor, a written warning can be issued. Normally, this step is undertaken only \nafter the supervisor has discussed the performance or work-related issue with their immediate \nsupervisor and HR business partner. The written warning is usually given to the staff member during or \nfollowing a meeting between the staff member and the supervisor. \nThis disciplinary document contains specific information about the nature of the problem, the \nimprovement needed, a timetable for future review and the consequences of continued unsatisfactory \nperformance. A copy of the documentation is placed in the staff member's personnel file. \nIf the performance or work-related issues are not resolved, the supervisor may institute a performance \nimprovement plan. This plan clearly articulates goals and objectives the staff member is expected to \nsuccessfully accomplish within a pre-determined time period. During that period, the supervisor meets \nwith the staff member on a regular basis to provide feedback and guidance on their progress. Staff Handbook: A Human Resources Guide \n \nPage | 43  \nIf a performance improvement plan is not appropriate, an additional written warning or a final written \nwarning may be issued. \n4D. Suspension \nStaff members who commit serious infractions of university policy or procedure or who have \ndemonstrated serious performance deficiencies may have their employment suspended for a period of \ntime. In addition, suspension may be imposed to permit an investigation prior to taking final action. This \nstep is undertaken after the supervisor has discussed the performance, behavior, or other work-related \nissue with their immediate supervisor and HR business partner. Details of the suspension will be \ncommunicated to the staff member in writing. A copy of this communication is placed in the staff \nmember’s personnel file. \n4E.
